                    was a witcher, a monster hunter for hire, who possessed superhuman abilities
                    and was a master swordsman. During the Trial of the Grasses, Geralt exhibited unusual
                    tolerance for the mutagens that grant witchers their abilities.  Accordingly, Geralt was
                    subjected to further experimental mutagens which rendered his hair white and may have 
                    given him greater speed, strength, and stamina than his fellow witchers.
